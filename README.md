Examples of connected (internet of things) devices, built using the Arduino software, Eagle circuit design software, the ATmega1284P microcontroller, and the CC3000 wifi module.

The master branch contains just the files common to all the examples. See the following branches for the individual examples:

* display: has a screen to show the weather or other online data (https://github.com/damellis/netwidget/tree/display)
* pair: each device has touch sensing and an RGB LED to allow remote communication (https://github.com/damellis/netwidget/tree/pair)
* sensor: logging temperature sensor data to data.sparkfun.com (https://github.com/damellis/netwidget/tree/sensor)
